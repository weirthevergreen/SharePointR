\title{Fast Write of a Data Frame to a CSV File on SharePoint}
\usage{
fwrite_sp(data, file_path, drive, overwrite = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or data.table to write to CSV.}

\item{file_path}{Character string. The path where the file should be written on the SharePoint drive.}

\item{drive}{A SharePoint drive object, as returned by \code{\link{get_sp_drive}}.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. If TRUE, overwrites the file if it already exists. Default is FALSE.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[data.table]{fwrite}}.}
}
\value{
Returns console message indicating status of export.

\description{
Quickly writes an R data frame to a CSV file on a SharePoint drive using
data.table's fwrite function, which is optimized for large files.
}
\details{
This function writes the data to a temporary CSV file using data.table's fast fwrite function
and then uploads it to SharePoint. The temporary file is automatically deleted after uploading.

The function leverages data.table's fast CSV writing capabilities, which can be significantly
faster than standard write.csv, especially for large datasets.

Folders in the file_path must already exist. The function will not create new folders.
If you want to write to a nested folder structure, ensure all folders exist
on the SharePoint drive first.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Connect to SharePoint and get drive
site <- connect_sharepoint("https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite")
drive <- get_sp_drive(site, "Documents")

# Create a large data frame
large_df <- data.frame(
  id = 1:1000000,
  value = rnorm(1000000),
  group = sample(letters, 1000000, replace = TRUE)
)

# Fast write to SharePoint
fwrite_sp(large_df, "large_data/a_gazillion_rows.csv", drive)

# With additional fwrite parameters
fwrite_sp(large_df, "data.csv", drive, sep = ";", dec = ",", quote = FALSE)
}
