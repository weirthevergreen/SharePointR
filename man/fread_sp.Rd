\title{Fast Read of a CSV File from SharePoint}
\usage{
fread_sp(file_path, drive, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Character string. The path to the CSV file on the SharePoint drive.}

\item{drive}{A SharePoint drive object, as returned by \code{\link{get_sp_drive}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[data.table]{fread}}.}
}
\value{
A data.table (which is also a data.frame) containing the CSV data.
}
\description{
Quickly reads a CSV file from SharePoint into an R data.table/data.frame using
data.table's fread function, which is optimized for large files.
}
\details{
This function downloads the CSV file to a temporary location and then reads it using
\code{\link[data.table]{fread}}, which is much faster than standard read.csv, especially
for large files. The temporary file is automatically deleted after reading.

The function leverages data.table's fast and flexible CSV parsing capabilities, including:
\itemize{
\item Automatic detection of column types
\item Faster processing of large files
\item More robust handling of various CSV formats
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Connect to SharePoint and get drive
site <- connect_sharepoint("https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite")
drive <- get_sp_drive(site, "Documents")

# Fast read of a large CSV file
large_data <- fread_sp("large_data/a_gazillion_rows.csv", drive)

# With additional fread parameters
data <- fread_sp("data.csv", drive, sep = ";", dec = ",", select = c(1, 3, 5))

# Read only specific columns by name
data <- fread_sp("data.csv", drive, select = c("Date", "Value", "Category"))
}
