\title{Save an R Object to an RDS File on SharePoint}
\usage{
sp_write_rds(object, file_path, drive, overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The R object to save (not quoted).}

\item{file_path}{Character string. The path where the file should be written on the SharePoint drive.}

\item{drive}{A SharePoint drive object, as returned by \code{\link{get_sp_drive}}.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. If TRUE, overwrites the file if it already exists. Default is FALSE.}

\value{

\description{
Saves a single R object to an .rds file and uploads it to SharePoint.
}
\details{
This function saves a single R object to a temporary .rds file using \code{saveRDS()}
and then uploads it to SharePoint. The temporary file is automatically deleted after uploading.

Folders in the file_path must already exist. The function will not create new folders.
If you want to save to a nested folder structure, ensure all folders exist
on the SharePoint drive first.

Unlike \code{sp_save()} which can save multiple objects, this function saves
only one object at a time but preserves the exact object structure.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Connect to SharePoint and get drive
site <- connect_sharepoint("https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite")
drive <- get_sp_drive(site, "Documents")

# Create a model to save
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars)

# Save the model to SharePoint
sp_write_rds(model, "models/regression_model.rds", drive)

# Overwrite an existing file
sp_write_rds(model, "models/regression_model.rds", drive, overwrite = TRUE)

# Save a data frame
sp_write_rds(mtcars, "data/mtcars_dataset.rds", drive)
}
