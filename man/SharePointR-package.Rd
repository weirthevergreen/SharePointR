\section{Authentication}{

Most functions require a valid access token provided by \code{\link{connect_sharepoint}}.
The token is stored and reused internally during the R session and managed by the MS365R package.

Authentication from R to SharePoint requires that you can successfully
log into and access the target SharePoint site through your default web browser. If you
encounter HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) errors during connection, ensure that you can open and
navigate the desired SharePoint site in your default browser before attempting to connect
via the SharePointR package. This browser-based authentication prerequisite is necessary
for the underlying Microsoft365R authentication flow.
